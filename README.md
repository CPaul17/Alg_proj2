In order to run this project you must first run the following commands:
pip install Pillow
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy

or you can do pip install -r requirements
I highly recommend doing all this in a virtual environment

By doing this coding part of the hw I chose to do part2 of the hw 
instead of part 1.

Part A of the hw has been done in the file `checkWin_complete.py` and is 
marked as such with comments. Part B of the HW which is the collaborative 
part of the hw has been implemented in `checkWin_complete.py` and is 
marked as such with comments as well.


Part A's logic can be called from the following function `checkWinPos()` in 
`checkWin_complete.py`. This function is called in `TicTacProjac_complete.py` 
when the AI is set to 2.

Part B's logic can be called from the following function `minimaxalg()` in 
`checkWin_complete.py`. This function is called in `TicTacProjac_complete.py` 
when the AI is set to 3. `minimaxalg()` is a recursive function and I utilized
a recursive way to solve the problem.
